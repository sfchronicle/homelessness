        <div class="chatter">Out of all supportive housing sites overseen by the Human Services Agency, the Crosby hotel had by far the most building code violations between 2015 and August of 2016. The number of violations has decreased this year, suggesting that Episcopal Community Services has amped up its efforts to maintain the residential hotel, which is among the most difficult in its portfolio. The number of violations could indicate both tenant frustration and building maintenance concerns.<p>* These properties recently transitioned to supportive housing. Many of the violations were issued prior to becoming supportive housing.</p></div>
